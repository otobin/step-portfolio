      <p>Here are the best coffee shops in Davis, ranked in terms of good tasting coffee, ambiance, and wifi speed.</p>

      <p>Best Coffee Shops in Davis</p>
      <div id="philz">
        <li>Philz Coffee</li>
        <p>It simply does not get much better than philz. VERY strong coffee that will definitely make you dizzy if you drink it on an empty stomach. 
            An exquisite selection of hand crafted coffees in addition to assorted bagels and toast. Super fast wifi. Noise level is great
            for cramming for a midterm or working on a group projet with friends. Literally the most wholesome place in the universe.
        </p> 
      </div>
      <div id="mishkas">
        <li>Mishka's Cafe</li>
        <p> Mishka's has a great selection of basic lattes and drinks and extremely delicious baked goods. They would edge out Philz if their wifi 
            didn't have a 2 hour limit and they weren't constantly packed with cranky grad students. Overall, a great place to take your parents to show 
            them what a *~hip and cool*~ college town Davis is!
        </p> 
      </div>
      <div id="peets">
        <li>Peet's Coffee</li>
        <p>Classic, predictable, and consistent. Peet's quality is surprisingly good for a nationwide chain. 
        </p> 
      </div>
      <div id="temple">
        <li>Temple Coffee Roasters</li>
        <p>If Temple was a student at Davis, they'd be an RA with a 4.0. Not great wifi, pretty bitter coffee, and an austere modern 
            layout instead of the cozy vibes from a classic coffee shop. Also a limited selection of only pastries and no bagels.

      <div id="asucd">
        <li>ASUCD Coffee House</li>
        <p>A great go to for in between classes.
