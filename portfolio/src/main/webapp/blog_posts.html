      <h2>A Closed System: 5 Easy Ways NOLS Taught me to be Greener</h2>
      <p>On a Wednesday evening in August, I stepped off a plane in the San Francisco Airport after completing a 30 day backpacking course with the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). 
          I was overwhelmed with a flood of different emotions: relief from finally coming home, sadness leaving the expedition group that had become my second family over the course of the last month, 
          and shock from returning to the bustle of the Bay Area. </p>
      <p>On the car ride home, I told my parents about all of the incredible things I had experienced over the last month. 
          I told them about the time I learned to do a headstand at the top of a mountain and the days the sunset behind the mountains 
          painted the sky pink. When I finally finished, my mom asked me what the most important thing I learned on NOLS was. I was silent.
           There were so many different lessons--concrete and abstract--that I took away from the course. Finally, it came to me: “The Earth is a closed system.”</p>
      <p>During the course, my group and I had to practice Leave No Trace principles, which is exactly what it sounds like. Everything that we produced 
          (trash, food waste, dishwater, etc…) had to be carried with us or properly disposed of. Our expedition was a closed system--there was no such 
          thing as throwing something away. Empty food bags became drybags for headlamps and batteries, unused bandanas served as towels for dirty dishes, 
          and we shared leftovers to prevent food waste and empty stomachs. Upon returning home, it dawned on me how often we think that throwing something 
          away means that it disappears. Completing a NOLS course taught me a variety of easy ways that I can live my life differently in order to lessen my 
          impact on our closed system. Here are five that particularly stood out to me: </p>
     <p> 1. Thrift </p>
     <p>After wearing the same shirt and pants for thirty days without showering, a closet full of clean, new clothes seemed laughably excessive. 
         As it turns out, making a new pair of jeans takes roughly 1,800 gallons of water and emits greenhouse gasses equivalent to driving 80 miles. 
         Buying used clothing restricts excessive emissions and keeps clothing out of the landfill. Furthermore, online thrift stores such as thredUP 
         and Swap make it easier than ever to buy and sell used clothing. </p>
    <p> 2. Eat Less Meat </p>
    <p> During the course, my instructor gave an eye opening lesson on the differences between public lands and protected lands. 
        Prior to NOLS, I thought that the natural resources on public lands were protected. However, public lands can be used for grazing, 
        which erodes streams and causes weed infestations. In addition, a recent study by the University of California, Davis on the connection 
        between climate and diet showed that substituting a serving of vegetables for beef saves nearly 316 grams of carbon. Cutting down on meat 
        lessens greenhouse gasses significantly and prevents grazing on public lands. </p>
    <p> 3. Opt for a Greener Commute </p>
    <p> 30 days of walking with a 60 pound pack showed me that a 10 minute walk to the grocery store is trivial, as is a 15 minute bike ride to 
        my college campus. Greener modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and train not only emit less greenhouse gasses, 
        but also improve one’s quality of life by encouraging active lifestyles. If it’s not possible to take one of these modes to work, 
        then carpooling with a friend is also an excellent way to improve your commute while reducing your carbon footprint. </p>
    <p> 4. Be a diligent Recycler </p>
    <p>Too often, I’ve seen people on my college campus throw away something that is perfectly recyclable or recycle something that is not. 
        Recycling things with food residue or grease can contaminate an entire load of recycling. Take a couple minutes to educate yourself 
        on what is recyclable and what isn’t in your hometown, as it can empty landfills and make recycling collection more efficient. </p> 
    <p> 5. Reuse </p>
    <p> In order to optimize the space in our packs and practice Leave No Trace, we needed to minimize what we carried and utilize supplies for multiple purposes. 
        My experience on NOLS taught me to think critically about what things can be reused in different ways. In my apartment, my roommates and I use 
        recyclable plastic and glass containers as storage for other foods or as makeshift flower pots. I also always make sure to bring my own reusable 
        container and straw to coffee shops or restaurants in order to eliminate single use plastic. Thinking about dual use minimizes waste and encourages 
        creative thinking. </p> 
    <p> Whether I’m carpooling with someone or buying groceries, I try to think about what I leave behind. 
        It can be easy to not think twice about throwing away old clothing or taking a two minute drive to the grocery store, 
        but everything that we do on earth has tangible and inadvertent effects. All effort--big and small--helps lessen our impact on the earth. </p>
